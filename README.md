# bard-djangowork
django version

Switched over my command line game into a web app.  

It is fully deployed on GCP
https://bardwithbard.ue.r.appspot.com/

Still adding functionality to it, and some add-ons here and there.
Happy with the main app, but need to adjust original sonnets as well as a few other things.
Eventually webscraper to get the original sonnet links from Patrick Stewart.
