    Choose how many words you want to replace and if you want a random or specific sonnet.
        Combinations are random, so even if you pick the same sonnet, it may replace different words.
        Have fun.

        Also this is inspired by Patrick Stewart so you will find a link to his elegant
        readings in the corner.  </h2>
